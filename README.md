### Four Business Analytics Problems and Solution in R 

## Problem 1
The Northwest regional manager of Logan Outdoor Equipment Company has conducted a study to determine how her store managers are allocating their time. A study was undertaken over three weeks that collected the following data related to the percentage of time each store manager spent on the tasks of attending required meetings, preparing business reports, customer interaction, and being idle.
### Data : data1.csv

a. Create a stacked bar chart with locations along the vertical axis. Reformat the bar chart to best display these data by adding axis labels, a chart title, and so on.\
b. Create a clustered bar chart with locations along the vertical axis and clusters of tasks. Reformat the bar chart to best display these data by adding axis labels, a chart title, and the like. \
c. Create multiple bar charts where each location becomes a single bar chart showing the percentage of time spent on tasks. Reformat the bar charts to best display these data by adding axes labels, a chart title, and so forth. \
d. Which form of bar chart (stacked, clustered, or multiple) is preferable for these data? Why? \
e. What can we infer about the differences among how store managers are allocating their time at the different locations?


## Problem 2
Resorts & Spas, a magazine devoted to upscale vacations and accommodations, published its Reader’s Choice List of the top 20 independent beachfront boutique hotels in the world. The data shown are the scores received by these hotels based on the results from Resorts & Spas’ annual Readers’ Choice Survey. Each score represents the percentage of respondents who rated a hotel as excellent or very good on one of three criteria (comfort, amenities, and in-house dining). An overall score was also reported and used to rank the hotels. The highest ranked hotel, the Muri Beach Odyssey, has an overall score of 94.3, the highest component of which is 97.7 for in-house dining.
### Data : data2.csv

a. Determine the estimated multiple linear regression equation that can be used to predict the overall score given the scores for comfort, amenities, and in-house dining. \
b. Use the F test to determine the overall significance of the regression relationship. What is the conclusion at the 0.01 level of significance? \
c. Use the t test to determine the significance of each independent variable. What is the conclusion for each test at the 0.01 level of significance? \
d. Remove all independent variables that are not significant at the 0.01 level of significance from the estimated regression equation. What is your recommended estimated regression equation? 


## Problem 3
Approximately 1.65 million high school students take the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) each year, and nearly 80 percent of the college and universities without open admissions policies use SAT scores in making admission decisions. The current version of the SAT includes three parts: reading comprehension, mathematics, and writing. A perfect combined score for all three parts is 2400. A sample of SAT scores for the combined three-part SAT are in the dataset.
### Data : data3.csv

a. Show a frequency distribution and histogram. Begin with the first bin starting at 800, and use a bin width of 200. \
b. Comment on the shape of the distribution. \
c. What other observations can be made about the SAT scores based on the tabular and graphical summaries?\


## Problem 4
Reports have found that many U.S. adults would rather live in a different type of community than where they are living. A national survey of 2260 adults asked: “Where do you live now?” and “What do you consider to be the ideal community?” Response options were City (C), Suburb (S), Small Town (T), or Rural (R). A representative portion of this survey for a sample of 100 respondents is in the dataset.
### Data : data4.csv

a. Provide a percent frequency distribution and a histogram for each question. \
b. Where are most adults living now? \
c. Where do most adults consider the ideal community? \
d. What changes in living areas would you expect to see if people moved from where they currently live to their ideal community?
